# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Pack should provide an interactive mode for building images, updating dependencies, and viewing CVE notices. Please see [mockup](https://storage.googleapis.com/artifacts.cf-garden-windows-dev.appspot.com/pack-interact-edit.mp4) for concept.

# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

* [Pack](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack) - A tool provided by the buildpacks organization for converting code into runnable images, in a local environment.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The **casual application developer** has trouble seeing the value proposition of buildpacks. They also encounter a high learning curve when using our tooling. We've seen evidence of this through user interviews and other channels. By providing an interactive experience with additional functionality, the casual application developer will be more enticed to remain within the buildpacks ecosystem.

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

Please note: _This RFC does not intend to provide something fully realized. Instead, it aims to introduce the concept and have it be shaped by discussion, feasibility, and utility._

When a casual application developer runs `pack interact` on the command-line in the working directory of their application, they are provided with an interactive panel where they can perform activities related to converting code into runnable images. An interactive panel is a good conduit for introducing the following 3 sets (all of which are subject to discussion) of functionality:

1. **CVE detection.** One of our marquee features is **rebasing**. But when someone does a **(r) rebase** and sees CVEs go away, the value will be much more pronounced.
1. **Break between detection and compilation.** Buildpacks should be known as a tool that writes (90%) of your Dockerfiles for you. You should be allowed to **see** and **(e) edit** the individual steps that are autogenerated for you. And when you compile, you see the **implementation buildpacks** (steps) being traversed. It is important that a little description is provided for each implementation buildpack to provide insight into what is happening.
1. **Updates.** One thing Dockerfiles can't do is update hardcoded dependencies. We should be able to show when buildpacks, lifecycle, stack, etc can be upgraded so that the user gets a sense of value.

---

1. **Build Hijack.** A natural follow-up step would be to introduce the ability to open a shell for debugging, into a failed build container.

TBD.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- It will require a lot of effort and coordination to accomplish. Next steps, before the RFC is even merged, should be to **perform user research** to see if value is being provided.

# Alternatives

- Find other means to entice the casual application developer into the buildpacks ecosystem.
